```

npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.jsx`: Entry point, sets up MUI theme provider
- `src/theme.js`: MUI theme configuration
- `src/App.jsx`: Main app component (edit this to start building your app)
